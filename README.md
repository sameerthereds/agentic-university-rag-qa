# ðŸ§  Agentic University QA System with RAG + LLMs

This project is an **interactive information retrieval system** that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **instruction-tuned large language models** (LLaMA 3.1 and Mistral) to answer queries based on web-scraped content from the University of Memphis website.

Built with **Streamlit**, it enables real-time question answering with semantic search, customizable model selection, and transparent context display.
